  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  The theme of this chapter is classmaps.  You'll learn how to find and read the classmaps that we provide.  This will immediately enable you to run a smooth coding class -- and it will begin to prepare you to create your own classmaps in the future.

  There's only one stop: @b{Bruce's House}.

  Oh, and as we've said before: Metapolis is a city that exists outside of the normal space and time of your world.  It matters because today, you'll be doing some time traveling. 
  
  You'll be visiting Bruce at a time before his first class has started.  He won't remember you because he won't meet you until that first day of class at @b{Lovelace Elementary} in Chapter 3.  The point is to show you how coaches prepare for their first day, in part by selecting the appropriate class launch map.
