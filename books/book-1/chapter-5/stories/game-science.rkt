  You pass the now familiar model of Babbage's Analytical Enginenin in the Neuroscience wing of Babbage University and take the stairs up to Professor Istoria's office.  

  "Back again, I see," says Istoria, as you walk in.  "Have a seat."

  "I suppose you know why I'm here," you say, taking a seat.

  "Well let's get to it, shall we?  Games, games, games..." He mutters, before stopping suddenly and fixing you with a piercing gaze.  "Are you in a state of flow right now?" 

  "Um, I don't know."  You say.  "I have heard that phrase a couple times -- 'state of flow' or 'flow state' -- what does that mean?"

  "I'm asking the questions, you are answering them.  You remember this game, yes?"

  You sigh inwardly.

  .....
  ...
  ..
  . EDITING PAUSED HERE!

  "So polite," he said.  "How long has it been since you sat down?"
  
  "Just a few seconds."

  "And were you aware of those seconds?"

  "A few of them."

  "Then you were @i{not} in a flow state," he says.  He rummages in his desk and returns with a sheet of gold stars -- the kind a grade school teacher might use.  Delicately, he peels off one of them and keeps it on the end of his index finger.  "What is flow?" he asks.

  "I guess you're trying to get me to say that it's a state where you're not quite aware of the passage of time."

  He reaches across the desk to give you the gold star.  Not knowing quite what to do with it, you stick it to the back of your hand.  By the time you've done so, he has already pealed off the next one.

  "Tell me more," he says.

  "I've gathered from the coach training thus far that MetaCoders classes are alternations between Story Mode and Game Mode.  In Story Mode, coaches communicate information, ideas, and values in the form of stories and discussions -- with the ideal goal of inducing a kind of deep engagement scientists call 'narrative transporation'." He slowly begins to extend the gold star to you.  You go on, encouraged: "I'm guessing that in Game Mode, we do the same thing, but with flow state.  Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe narrative transportation and flow state are the same?"

  Suddenly, he stops, scowls, and retracts the gold star.  "If they were the same, why would they need different names?  Have you seen a child engaged in a game?  Does it look @i{exactly} like a child engaged in a story?  Have you played a game?  Does that feel @i{exactly} like when you sit down in a movie theater?"

  "Okay, okay, maybe they aren't exactly the same.  But still," you argue, "they don't seem entirely different.  Video games and movies both make me lose track of time."

  He tears the gold star in half. "I suppose you're half right."  He hands you the half-star, which you place on the back of your hand.  "But half right is also half wrong.  Two things can both cause us to lose track of time yet still be distinct states of mind.  When you're at the movies, and it doesn't turn out the way you want, do you buy another ticket and watch it again, hoping for a new ending?  When you read a book, and the ending sucks, do you blame yourself?"

  You laugh.  "I see what you're saying.  In games, we have a kind of agency -- we have a goal, a way of achieving it, and things standing in our way.  I suppose you could say that we're @i{enacting} a story, not just trying to understand one being told to us.  So when it turns out badly, we know it was our own fault -- and we often feel a desire to try again -- assuming we feel the game was fair and balanced, and that we have a shot at doing better the next time."

  He gives you the other half of the gold star.  "Are games the only way of inducing flow state?" 

  "You haven't yet told me exactly what a flow state is," you observe.  "But I'm guessing it's both a feeling being highly absorbed, losing track of time, @i{and} feeling like you have some control over the situation..." You ponder for a moment.  "... but not @i{too} much control.  Things have to be a bit unpredictable, or else they get boring, and the flow state is gone..."  You glance at him to see if you're on the right track.  His face is unreadable as he inspects the way the light from the open window hits the next gold star on his fingertip.  "I suppose someone could feel a state of flow with pretty much anything.  Cooking -- for example.  I could imagine someone getting absorbed in the challenge of cooking a challenging recipe.  Or when playing music -- I could imagine someone getting into a state of flow -- as long as the piece isn't too easy or too hard."

  He hands you the star.  "Being 'in the zone,'" he says. "That's what atheletes call it. Psychologists starting calling it 'flow state' in 1975."  Seeing your surprise, he nods, "Yes, we've been studying this state of mind for a long time.  Like narrative transportation, it's a state that seems to be deeply human.  Children experience it.  Adults do.  It spans cultures and geographies.  Games have been with our species for -- well -- how long do you think?"

  "I know that chess is an extremely old game.  And we've been doing the Olympics for thousands of years.  I'm not an expert, but I would guess that human brains have been making up games and getting into flow states for as long as we've had language -- 200,000 years or so.  Maybe even longer."

  "Give me back the gold stars," he says, much to your disappointment.  

  Wondering what you got wrong, you peal off the three stars and hand them back.  Professor Istoria throws them into the trashcan beside his desk.  He rummages around and finds a fidget spinner and hands it to you.

  "Well done," he says.  "This is yours now." 

  You take it and say thanks.  

  "But," he says.  "Use it wisely.  It isn't just a fidget spinner."

  "It's not?" you say, spinning it and examining it very closely.  "It certainly looks like one." 

  "Let me repeat myself.  It isn't @i{just} a fidget spinner.  It is one.  But it isn't @i{just} one."

  "Okay..." you say.  "It looks like just a fidget spinner, though."

  "It's also a game piece," he says.  "In this game we're playing right now.  Three stars gets you a fidget spinner.  One figet spinner..."

  "Gets me what?" you ask.  

  "Gets you nothing," he says.  "But @i{two} fidget spinners can be exchanged for a secret prize."

  "Are you trying to teach me about gamification?"

  He ignores you.  "Study this for a moment."  He hands you a card with information on it.  "It's direct from Wikipedia."

  @card{
    @card-body{
    Flow experiences imply a growth principle. When one is in a flow state, they are working to master the activity at hand. To maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challenges. Attempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one's skills. One emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great "feelings of competence and efficacy". By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning also increases.

    Flow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity, teaching, learning, and sports.
    }
  }

  When you are finished: "Assume," he says, "a coach or teacher knows how to craft experiences that induce flow states, how might they leverage that skill in an educational environment?"

  "The card seems to suggest that flow states increase motivation and self-directed learning, so I guess I would try to give my students as many flow state opportunities as possible.  Like educational video games and stuff."

  He doesn't answer.  He just wordlessly takes a gold star from his sheet and, instead of giving it to you, throws it into the trash.

  "I guess I would try gamifying my classroom, to make things fun.  Like, I would give out gold stars and fidget spinners ..."

  Another gold star goes into the trashcan.

  You try a third time.  "I would give stars to students who successfully get into a flow ..." As he begins to waste another perfectly good gold star, you protest, "I can't be that far off.  I mean, games are fun and engaging, and you just showed me a card that suggests that there's science behind flow states and performance gains.   If flow states can be woven into a classroom, why wouldn't you do it?"

  The gold star sticks to his finger and won't go into the trashcan.  He shakes it, but it stays.  Still trying to shake it off, he says, "This is the problem with non-scientists.  You hear 'flow states are good' and immediately think 'give kids more flow states'.  It's not wrong, but it's crude and reductive.  What @i{kind} of flow states?  How will you induce them?  How do you make sure that what students learn during flow states are what you wanted them to learn in the first place?"

  "With coding..." you say, causing him to pause his efforts to trash the gold star, "... I guess my goal is to induce flow states in which students are writing, reading, or editing code.  If it was a Spanish class, I suppose my goal would be to induce flow states in which students are speaking, reading, or writing in Spanish.  Languages take a @i{lot} of practice before you start recalling things effortlessly -- fluently."

  He hands over the gold star.  Strangely proud, you put it on your hand and give your fidget spinner a whirl.  You go on: "Or... because at MetaCoders we also train teamwork and leadership, a Game Mode that induces a flow state around working with other students has the byproduct that students learn to work in teams, or in leadership roles.  This opens up options for more complex Game Modes in later classes." 

  "A coding flow state," says Istoria.  "Have you ever experienced it?"

  "Maybe," you say.  "I made my coach bio, which I coded and pushed to Github.  But I don't know."

  "How would you induce a coding flowstate for yourself?"

  "I guess with coding, it depends on whether my skill in the language at hand matches the task I'm trying to do in the language at hand.  One thing that takes me out of the flow state is all the error messages, though."

  He grunts in disapproval.   He hands you a card.  "Read me the third criteria for flow states." 

  @card{
    @card-body{
      @card-text{
        @b{Incredients for Flow States}
        @ul{
          @li{Feeling the potential to succeed.}
          @li{Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible.}
          @li{Immediate feedback.}
        }
      }
    }
  }

  "Immediate feedback," you say.

  "Let me ask you," he says.  "When you run a program with errors in it, how quickly do you get back an error message?"

  "Immediately, I guess."

  "Those error messages on the computer are a constant stream of one of the key ingredients of flow," he says.  "Saying that they take you @i{out} of the flow state is like a tennis player saying that the net breaks the flow state, or a basketball player saying that the tiny hoop does.  As you said, the Olypmics has been running for thousands of years.  Did you ever wonder why sports games are such powerful flow state inducers?"

  "I guess the world around us gives us immediate feedback on our performance.  We can see the ball go in the hoop with our own eyes; we don't have to wait a week for a teacher to hand us back our basketball grades to know if we made our shots."

  "And what would a coach say to a young player who complained that the hoop was distracting from their state of flow."

  Voluntarily, you peal off the gold star and give it back to him.  "You're right," you say.  

  But he is not letting you off the hook, "Right about what?"

  "How you see the error messages is a matter of perspective.  Bugs are evidence of our own lack of fluency, things we did wrong but didn't know at the time.  If you look at it with a positive spin, the computer is politely informing us that we didn't understand something.  It's like a parent correcting a child when they misspeak.  If you look at it that way, the errors don't have to take you out of your flow state."

  He gives you back your gold star.  "So we've covered that Game Mode is less about games and more about a state of mind.  Why do you think MetaCoders calls it Game Mode?"

  "We do play games during Game Mode," you point out.  "But we also do drills and activities.  I guess they're all game-@i{like}."

  "So Game Mode is for game-like things?"

  You spin the fidget spinner, lost in thought.  Istoria patiently waits.  His sheet of gold stars is almost empty, only two left.

  Finally, you say, "Maybe it's also to help students understand what we want from them.  We want them to learn how to become engaged with coding in the same way that they engage with video games or sports.  But they don't all realize that they can -- because doing so is an inner cognitive task.  So we call it Game Mode, to help them understand that their brains should be in the same mode as when they play games.  If we asked kids to 'put their brains into a flow state' -- they wouldn't necessarily know what we're talking about.  But -- put your brains in 'game mode' is an easier starting point for what we're asking them to do."

  He gives you the second-to-last star.  You put it on your hand with the other one.  You're suddenly curious what two fidget spinners will get you.  Will it be a some kind of gag gift?  Maybe a book?  Maybe just a card full of information? 

  "Cognitive load," he says.  "If you hang out in the Department of Neuroscience and just listen, you'll hear my colleagues and I use that phrase quite often -- more often than 'flow state' in fact.  What do you think it means?" 

  "The load on your mind at any given time, I would guess.  Like if you're strolling through the park, you might have less on your mind than if you're, say, doing a math problem in your head or juggling.  Or doing both at once."

  "Psychologists have been studying cognitive load and the limitations of working memory since the 1960s," he says.  "How many things can the human mind keep in its working memory at one time?"

  "I think I remember this one from Intro to Psychology," you say.  "It's seven, plus or minus two.  Right?"

  He nods but doesn't give you the gold star.  "And how does cognitive load relate to the inducing of flow states." 

  "I would guess that if your cognitive load is too low, then you're bored -- so no flow.  In fact, the definition of flow is total absorption in the task at hand, so I suppose that cognitive load should be high.  When I'm in the zone in a game or sport, I feel like my entire self is focused on that one thing."

  "So if you raise cognitive load, you induce flow?" he asks, beginning to hand you the last star.

  You sense it's a trap.  You don't answer.  Istoria pauses. 

  "No," you say. "If a child's mind is on his math test he failed earlier and the fact that his best friend has strep throat and the fact that his computer keeps giving him error messages -- that's a lot of cognitive load, but none of it aids the task at hand.  So it's all just inner noise that distracts from any flow state they might experience."

  Istoria gives you a rare smile.  "Go on," he says.  "How can one provide metacognitive coaching that helps students like that get into a flow state?"

  You want the gold star, but you find yourself coming up blank.  After a moment's though you say, "I don't know.  It depends on the student.  For some, maybe it's enough to explain that Game Mode involves putting distractions out of your mind.  For some, you might have to notice that they're distracted, listen to what they say, and help them choose to set their problems aside for a moment.  This feels like the part of coaching that's the most subtle.  I really don't know..."

  You half-hope that Istoria will give you card that contains the secret to making any student inspired and focused.  But instead, he simply gives you the final gold star.  "Well done," he says.  "Would you like to trade in your stars for another fidget spinner?"

  You nod, pealing off the stars.  When the exchange is complete, you have a red fidget spinner in one hand and a blue one in the other. 

  "Now," he says, "I'm about to give you the option of trading in the two spinners for something else.  But first, I must ask you -- did these gold stars and fidget spinners help you achieve a flow state during our conversation?"

  "Um... I guess maybe..."

  "Stop being polite."

  "Not really," you say.  "It was fun, but it didn't exactly put me into a flow state."  

  He tugs his beard in approval.  "Gamification," he says. "It's a hot topic these days.  There are teachers gamifying their classrooms with experience points and badges.  There are businesses gamifying commerce with point systems and rewards.  There are scientists who create ed tech software with points, badges, digital marketplaces, unlockable content, and so on.  There's gamification everywhere.  Even MetaCoders gives badges to their students -- much like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts.  But I must ask you..."

  You lean forward, waiting for the question.   

  "Gameification and Game Mode both have the g-word in them," he says.  "How are the two related?  Or are they?"

  "I haven't personally seen a MetaCodesr coach giving out a badge yet," you say.  "But I've seen the badges on their coach and junior coach hoodies.  But to be honest, I feel like the badges are less about Game Mode and more about Story Mode."

  "Say more," he says.

  "Well, if a kid is getting a badge," you reason, "they probably aren't in a state of flow.  You have to stop what you're doing and receive the badge from the coach.  Plus, when a coach hands out a badge, I doubt they're being silent.  I can imagine them saying things like, 'Nice job.  You're getting this badge because of all the hard work you've been doing.'  That's a story.  Badges mean more when people know why they're getting them.  And then the badge on their hoodies gives them an external symbol of the story.  Students can point to the badges and tell the story of their growth as a MetaCoder."

  "Games and stories," says Istoria.  "They're two activities that almost every human being currently alive and every human being who has ever lived has participated in.  What a coincidence!  It's enough to make anyone ask -- are games and stories really so separate?  You yourself asked if narrative transportation and flow state are the same.  Maybe they are.  That's the kind of thing we study here at the Department of Neuroscience."  He holds out his hands.  "Do you want to trade your spinners?"

  You give him your spinners, reluctantly, thinking it unlikely that you will receive something of equal or greater value back.

  He holds both spinners up, one red, one blue.  He pauses dramatically, as if to let you know that this is the final question, the moment of truth.  "You can tell stories about games.  And you can play games that involve telling stories.  There are even things that blur the lines between games and stories.  A choose-your-own-adventure book is a story where you make choices -- so is it a game too?  In a roleplaying game, the Dungeon Master tells stories, but the players take part in the narrative -- is it a story or a game?  As a coach," he says, "some of your Story Modes may have some gamification involved and some of your Game Modes may have a storytelling component.  How can you tell the difference between a Game Mode and a Story Mode when the lines start getting blury?"

  "I guess it all comes down to narrative transportation versus flow state.  And maybe that comes down to cognitive load -- stories don't need to be cognitively difficult to understand in order to transport you.  Simple stories can still be powerful.  Even stories we've experienced before can still transport us.  Games, on the other hand -- they @i{should} to pose some cognitive difficulties if they are intended to induce a state of flow." 
  
  Without telling you if you're right or wrong, he writes down from memory the urls for the following YouTube videos on a card and hands it to you:

    }
  }

  He also hands you a book from his shelf.  You assume that these are your prises for the fidget spinners.  "It's less dense than the last one," he says.  

  @html/inline{<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B000W94FE6&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_psb3DbNFFN0P1" ></iframe>}
  
  "Thanks," you say, feeling a tiny bit cheated -- two solid fidget spinners in exchange for mere information.  It didn't seem like a fair trade.  As you get up to leave, to your surprise, he hands you a fresh sheet of gold stars and both fidget spinners back, along with a green one and a yellow one.   His desk drawer must be full of them. 
  
  "Coach," he says.  "Use them wisely.  In the hands of a good coach, a fidget spinner is not a fidget spinner, and a star is not a star."
