  You pass the now familiar model of Babbage's Analytical Engine and take the stairs up to Professor Istoria's office.  

  "Back for the second time, I see," says Istoria, as you walk in.  "Have a seat."

  "I suppose you know why I'm here," you say, taking a seat.

  "Sitting there in your chair, surrounded by books, listening to me talk, and wondering what wisdom I'm going to impart to you today -- I have a question about all of that.  Are you in a state of flow?" he asks.

  "I don't know.  Maybe, I guesss."

  "So polite," he said.  "How long has it been since you sat down?"
  
  "Just a few seconds."

  "And were you aware of those seconds?"

  "A few of them."

  "Then you were @i{not} in a flow state," he says.  He rummages in his desk and returns with a sheet of gold stars -- the kind a grade school teacher might use.  Delicately, he peels off one of them and keeps it on the end of his index finger.  "What is flow?" he asks.

  "I guess you're trying to get me to say that it's a state where you're not quite aware of the passage of time."

  He reaches across the desk to give you the gold star.  Not knowing quite what to do with it, you stick it to the back of your hand.  By the time you've done so, he has already pealed off the next one.

  "Tell me more," he says.

  "I've gathered from the coach training thus far that MetaCoders classes are alternations between Story Mode and Game Mode.  In Story Mode, coaches communicate information, ideas, and values in the form of stories and discussions -- with the ideal goal of inducing a kind of deep engagement scientists call 'narrative transporation'." He slowly begins to extend the gold star to you.  You go on, encouraged: "I'm guessing that in Game Mode, we do the same thing, but with flow state.  Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe narrative transportation and flow state are the same?"

  Suddenly, he stops, scowls, and retracts the gold star.  "If they were the same, why would they need different names?  Have you seen a child engaged in a game?  Does it look @i{exactly} like a child engaged in a story?  Have you played a game?  Does that feel @i{exactly} like when you sit down in a movie theater?"

  "Okay, okay, maybe they aren't exactly the same.  But still," you argue, "they don't seem entirely different.  Video games and movies both make me lose track of time."

  He tears the gold star in half. "I suppose you're half right."  He hands you the half-star, which you place on the back of your hand.  "But half right is also half wrong.  Two things can both cause us to lose track of time yet still be distinct states of mind.  When you're at the movies, and it doesn't turn out the way you want, do you buy another ticket and watch it again, hoping for a new ending?  When you read a book, and the ending sucks, do you blame yourself?"

  You laugh.  "I see what you're saying.  In games, we have a kind of agency -- we have a goal, a way of achieving it, and things standing in our way.  I suppose you could say that we're @i{enacting} a story, not just trying to understand one being told to us.  So when it turns out badly, we know it was our own fault -- and we often feel a desire to try again -- assuming we feel the game was fair and balanced, and that we have a shot at doing better the next time."

  He gives you the other half of the gold star.  "Are games the only way of inducing flow state?" 

  "You haven't yet told me exactly what a flow state is," you observe.  "But I'm guessing it's both a feeling being highly absorbed, losing track of time, @i{and} feeling like you have some control over the situation..." You ponder for a moment.  "... but not @i{too} much control.  Things have to be a bit unpredictable, or else they get boring, and the flow state is gone..."  You glance at him to see if you're on the right track.  His face is unreadable as he inspects the way the light from the open window hits the next gold star on his fingertip.  "I suppose someone could feel a state of flow with pretty much anything.  Cooking -- for example.  I could imagine someone getting absorbed in the challenge of cooking a challenging recipe.  Or when playing music -- I could imagine someone getting into a state of flow -- as long as the piece isn't too easy or too hard."

  He hands you the star.  "Being 'in the zone,'" he says. "That's what atheletes call it. Psychologists starting calling it 'flow state' in 1975."  Seeing your surprise, he nods, "Yes, we've been studying this state of mind for a long time.  Like narrative transportation, it's a state that seems to be deeply human.  Children experience it.  Adults do.  It spans cultures and geographies.  Games have been with our species for -- well -- how long do you think?"

  "I know that chess is an extremely old game.  And we've been doing the Olympics for thousands of years.  I'm not an expert, but I would guess that human brains have been making up games and getting into flow states for as long as we've had language -- 200,000 years or so.  Maybe even longer."

  "Give me back the gold stars," he says, much to your disappointment.  

  Wondering what you got wrong, you peal off the three stars and hand them back.  Professor Istoria throws them into the trashcan beside his desk.  He rummages around and finds a fidget spinner and hands it to you.

  "Well done," he says.  "This is yours now." 

  You take it and say thanks.  

  "But," he says.  "Use it wisely.  It isn't just a fidget spinner."

  "It's not?" you say, spinning it and examining it very closely.  "It certainly looks like one." 

  "Let me repeat myself.  It isn't @i{just} a fidget spinner.  It is one.  But it isn't @i{just} one."

  "Okay..." you say.  "It looks like just a fidget spinner, though."

  "It's also a game piece," he says.  "In this game we're playing right now.  Three stars gets you a fidget spinner.  One figet spinner..."

  "Get's me what?" you ask.  

  "If you get stuck on a question," he says, "you can exchange the fidget spinner for a chance to peek into any of my books."

  "Like a phone-a-friend?"

  He ignores you.  "Study this for a moment."  He hands you a card with information on it.  "It's direct from Wikipedia."

  @card{
    @card-body{
    Flow experiences imply a growth principle. When one is in a flow state, they are working to master the activity at hand. To maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challenges. Attempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one's skills. One emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great "feelings of competence and efficacy". By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning also increases.

    Flow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity, teaching, learning, and sports.
    }
  }

  When you are finished: "Assume," he says, "a coach or teacher knows how to craft experiences that induce flow states, how might they leverage that skill in an educational environment?"

  "The card seems to suggest that flow states increase motivation and self-directed learning, so I guess I would try to give my students as many flow state opportunities as possible.  Like educational video games and stuff."

  He doesn't answer.  He just wordlessly takes a gold star from his sheet and, instead of giving it to you, throws it into the trash.

  "I guess I would try gamifying my classroom, to make things fun.  Like, I would give out gold stars and fidget spinners ..."

  Another gold star goes into the trashcan.

  You try a third time.  "I would ____" As he begins to waste another perfectly good gold star, you protest, "I can't be that far off.  I mean, games are fun and engaging, and you just showed me a card that suggests that there's science behind flow states and performance gains.   If flow states can be woven into a classroom, why wouldn't you do it?"

  The gold star sticks to his finger and won't go into the trashcan.  He shakes it, but it stays.  Still trying to shake it off, he says, "This is the problem with non-scientists.  You hear 'flow states are good' and immediately think 'give kids more flow states'.  It's not wrong, but it's crude and reductive.  What @i{kind} of flow states?  How will you induce them?  How do you make sure that what students learn during flow states are what you wanted them to learn in the first place?"

  "With coding..." you say, causing him to pause his efforts to trash the gold star, "... I guess my goal is to induce flow states in which students are writing, reading, or editing code.  If it was a Spanish class, I suppose my goal would be to induce flow states in which students are speaking, reading, or writing in Spanish.  Languages take a @i{lot} of practice before you start recalling things effortlessly -- fluently."

  He hands over the gold star.  Strangely proud, you put it on your hand and give your fidget spinner a whirl.  You go on: "Or... because at MetaCoders we also train teamwork and leadership, a Game Mode that induces a flow state around working with other students has the byproduct that students learn to work in teams, or in leadership roles.  This opens up options for more complex Game Modes in later classes." 

  "A coding flow state," says Istoria.  "Have you ever experienced it?"

  "Maybe," you say.  "I made my coach bio, which I coded and pushed to Github.  But I don't know."

  "How would you induce a coding flowstate for yourself?"

  "I guess with coding, it depends on whether my skill in the language at hand matches the task I'm trying to do in the language at hand.  One thing that takes me out of the flow state is all the error messages, though."

  He grunts in disapproval.   He hands you a card.  "Read me the third criteria for flow states." 

  @card{
    @card-body{
      @card-text{
        @b{Incredients for Flow States}
        @ul{
          @li{Feeling the potential to succeed.}
          @li{Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible.}
          @li{Immediate feedback.}
        }
      }
    }
  }

  "Immediate feedback," you say.

  "Those error messages on the computer are a constant stream of one of the key ingredients of flow," he says.  "Saying that they take you out of the flow state is like a tennis player saying that the net breaks the flow state, or a basketball player saying that the tiny hoop takes them out of flow state.  As you said, the Olypmics has been running for thousands of years.  Did you ever wonder why sports games are such powerful flow state inducers?"

  "I guess the world around us gives us immediate feedback on our performance.  We can see the ball go in the hoop with our own eyes; we don't have to wait a week for a teacher to hand us back our basketball grades to know if we made our shots."

  "And what would a coach say to a young player who complained that the hoop was too small."

  Voluntarily, you peal off the gold star and give it back to him.  "You're right," you say.  

  But he is not letting you off the hook, "Right about what?"

  "How you see the error messages is a matter of perspective.  Bugs are evidence of our own lack of fluency, things we did wrong but didn't know at the time.  If you look at it with a positive spin, the computer is politely informing us that we didn't understand something.  It's like a parent correcting a child when they misspeak.  If you look at it that way, the errors don't have to take you out of your flow state."

  He gives you back your gold star.  "So we've covered that Game Mode is less about games and more about a state of mind -- getting everyone to be fully absorbed.    <<misconceptions about games>>"

  <<Clarify that Game Mode is less about games and more about a kind of engagement.  The word Game Mode is simply there to help communicate with children...>>
  <<Can you be in both states?  transported/flow -- Games that have stories.  Stories that contain games...>>

  Get kids to understand what flow state is, how it can be induced, why they should induce it.
    * Specifically with coding -- interaction with computer...
    * But also with important social games, etc...

  Just remember that games are fun, and addictive.  Stories inspire.   Stories help us play the right games for the right reasons.  They help us come back to the right games again and again, and avoid the wrong ones.
