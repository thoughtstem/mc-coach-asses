@paras{

You park at the rec center and are not surprised, upon entering, to see a picture
that appears to be Alan Turing.

@story-img[cumberbatch]

It's plaque, however, reveals that it is Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Alan Turing
in the biopic @i{The Imitation Game} -- which recounts the story of Alan Turing's 
influential role in the breaking of German codes during World War II. 

A real picture of Alan Turing is hanging outside the rec center's classroom.

@story-img[turing-running]

It notes that in addition to breaking codes during World War II, and in addition
to publishing some of the deepest, well-respected results in the field of theoretical
computer science, was also an accomplished long-distance runner, who had once run a 
2:46 marathon and would sometimes run 40 miles to attend meetings.

Inside the rec center arts and crafts room, you can tell that Ruby is just finishing 
her coach story, which tells you that this must be the first day of this MetaCoders class.

"And that's why the @i{next} Nanowrimo that I do is going to be a @i{digital} work of fiction, written
partially both in English @i{and} in code!"

She ends her story with such a zing that the kids say things like "woah" and "no way".
