  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this chapter, we'll be following Yu, who (much like you) is going through the MetaCoders coach training.

  Yu will be creating their Github account and their very first repo.  So will you.  But at MetaCoders we never ask anyone to do something without a clear understanding of @b{Why}.

  So head over to Coder Cafe, where we'll discuss this critically important topic.  That's the only one stop in this chapter.
