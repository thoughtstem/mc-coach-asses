  Welcome to Metapolis for the first time...
  (Model city...)
  (What is a model?)

  We'll taking you to several MetaCoders classrooms across the city.
  We'll look at the things that are common about all MetaCoders coaches -- the things they all do.  The things we expect you to learn.

  Most of all, we hope this chapter communicates to you the scope of the MetaCoders vision.  We need you to understand it because we need your help bringing that vision to life.  Thank you for being here.  We couldn't do this without you.  Together we can make this world a better place.

  Welcome to Metapolis.
