 First stop in the Chapter 1 Quest.

Outline:

- Where we are

- What is MetaCoder's presence here

- Purpose of Metapolis
      - See all the moving pieces that make Metacoders work in action
      - See how you, a training staff member, will fit in all this and progress
      - Stories make good teaching/learning tools (as we will learning about later in this quest...)
