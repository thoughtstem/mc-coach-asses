       As you walk the prestigious halls of Babbage University, you stop to admire a painting of Babbage himself, hanging on the wall.

       @(img src: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Charles_Babbage_-_1860.jpg/330px-Charles_Babbage_-_1860.jpg")

       Charles Babbage invented the computer, before there was electricity, before there were transistors, before there were LCD screens.  You are about to read the plaque beneath the painting when you hear children laughing down the hall -- and you remember that you're here to observe a MetaCoders classroom.

       Not wanting to be late, you hurry on down to the classroom that MetaCoders rents from the university for weekend classes.  Inside, you see a class of ___ students.  The coach Joseph is at the head of the classroom, telling a story.

       You stand in the doorway and listen, making the following observations:

       2nd stop in Chapter 1: Welcome quest

       
Outline:

Location intro -- longest running program/location

Coach intro -- who, how long a coach, other details

Leads into what level of Class Map construction coach is on (choosing from preset maps)

Use Class Launch example map

Coach is great an guiding students through the 2 mode of the Class Map model...

Intro Story mode
 - one point of focus (coach, student)
 - can look a lot of different ways
 - lower risk/challenge for most students
 - lower activity level

 Intro Game Mode
 - goal-oriented
 - different students/srudent groups can have different goals
 - multiple points of focus
 - usually where coding takes place
 - can be higher challenge/risk for students

 Similarities in modes?
 - coach always engaged, managing space
 - students always engaged
 - learning

Science behind these two modes...
