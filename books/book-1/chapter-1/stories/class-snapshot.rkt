       As you walk the prestigious halls of Babbage University, you stop to admire a painting of Babbage himself, hanging on the wall.

       @(img src: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Charles_Babbage_-_1860.jpg/330px-Charles_Babbage_-_1860.jpg")

       Charles Babbage invented the computer, before there was electricity, before there were transistors, before there were LCD screens -- or so you learn from the plaque beneath the painting.  Suddenly, you hear children laughing down the hall -- and you remember that you're here to observe a MetaCoders classroom.

       Not wanting to be late, you hurry on down to the classroom that MetaCoders rents from the university for weekend classes.  Inside, you see a class of ___ students.  The coach Joseph is at the head of the classroom, telling a story.

       You stand in the doorway and listen, making the following observations:

       @ul{
         @li{The students are @b{really} into this story.  Only a few of them even notice you're standing in the doorway.}
         @li{Joseph is a fantastic storyteller.  You realize, to your surprise, he's telling the story of Charles Babbage -- who invented a computer that could run programs that looked like punched holes in cards.}
         @li{It's the same story you began to read on the plaque beneath the painting, but Joseph is masterfully adapting the story to his audience of third and fourth graders.  He asks them questions, like, "How do you think Babbage's computer moved if it didn't use electricity?"  And "What do you think life would be like today if he hadn't invented the computer?"}
       }

       As Joseph wraps up the story, he announces, "Okay, that's it for Story Mode for now.  If there's time at the end of class, we'll do another Story Mode, and I'll tell you how Babbage and a woman named Ada Lovelace figured out how to programs for that computer before it was even built."  He then tells the class that they are switching to "Game Mode".  All of the students seem to know what "Story Mode" and "Game Mode" mean -- and you too begin to get an intuition about the two modes as Joseph passes out what look like hexagonal playing cards to each student and instructs them all to spend the next ten minutes writing the code on the card and then doing something creative with it.  He sets a coach timer and shouts "Go!"

       The room goes silent, save for the clicking of keyboards.  Joseph takes this moment to come over to you.

       "Welcome to Metapolis," he whispers.  "I'm Joseph."

       "You're good at telling stories," you say, shaking his hand.

       "You will be too," says Joseph.  "Stories and games are the heart of everything we do at MetaCoders.  Then again, you've probably figured that out already -- given that we're both in a story right now."

       "Yeah," you say. "I had a feeling.  What is Game Mode?"

       "Ah," says Joseph.  "At MetaCoders, there are only two main 'modalities' that a MetaCoders class should be in.  As a coach, you get trained to facilitate those two modalities and to switch between them."  He gestures at the students, all intently staring at their computers.  "Each mode has a distinct 'feel' or 'energy'.  As you can see, in Game Mode, every student's attention is on their task at hand.  In Story Mode, their attention is on you -- unless you choose to redirect it, like when you ask questions to keep your audience engaged."  Joseph leans closer.  "I'll tell you a secret: Before becoming a MetaCoders coach, I wasn't nearly as good at it then as I am today."

       "I'm kind of nervous about teaching my first class," you say.

       "Coaching," says Joseph.  "Not teaching.  At MetaCoders, we always say 'Coaching'."

       "Why?" 

       "If I remember correctly, you'll learn more about that in Chapter ___," says Joseph.  "As for being nervous, don't be.  By the time you begin coaching, you'll have been trained on Story Mode, Game Mode, and the art of transitioning.  Plus," he went on, "you won't be expected to create your own classmaps until you're a Level 2 coach."

       "Am I supposed to know what a classmap?"

       "No," he said. "I'm secretly training you by dropping the key vocabularly that you need to know as a MetaCoders coach.  A classmap is an outline of what stories you will tell and what games you will run for the duration of a class."

       "So it's like a lesson plan?"

       "We don't say lesson plan, and we don't say teach.  Again, you'll learn more about why we have our own words in Chapter ___.  The short answer is that coaching isn't quite the same as teaching, and classmaps aren't quite the same as lesson plans.  If it helps to think about them that way for now, that's fine.  I know I did when I first started."

       "Okay, so let me see if I understand.  A MetaCoders class is a sequence of alternating Story Modes and Game Modes, and the map tells you which one to do when?"

       "Daaaang," said Joseph.  "Are you sure you haven't already gone through the MetaCoders training?  Alright, since you're practically an expert, let me give you the official guidelines for Story Mode and Game Mode."  He rummages around in his pocket and finds a slip of paper that he hands to you.  It reads:

       @card{
        @b{Story Mode:}
        @ul{
          @li{one point of focus (coach, student)}
          @li{can look a lot of different ways}
          @li{lower risk/challenge for most students}
          @li{lower activity level}
        }

        @b{Game Mode}
        @ul{
          @li{goal-oriented}
          @li{different students/srudent groups can have different goals}
          @li{multiple points of focus}
          @li{usually where coding takes place}
          @li{can be higher challenge/risk for students}
        }
       }

      "Can I keep this?" you ask.

      "Sorry," says Joseph.  "I need it back.  But the nice thing about us both being characters in a story is that we're not going anywhere.  Metapolis is timeless.  So is Babbage University.  So is this conversation we're having.  I'll always be right here, in Chapter 1, at Babbage University, teaching this exact class every time you come back.  So as long as you remember where you learned something in Metapolis, you can always find it again."

Outline:

Location intro -- longest running program/location

Coach intro -- who, how long a coach, other details

Leads into what level of Class Map construction coach is on (choosing from preset maps)

Use Class Launch example map

Coach is great an guiding students through the 2 mode of the Class Map model...


 Similarities in modes?
 - coach always engaged, managing space
 - students always engaged
 - learning

Science behind these two modes...
