  As you walk into Hopper Library, you see two pictures hanging on a wall.  One is a photograph of a piece of paper with a moth taped to it.  The plaque beneath it simply reads, "a literal computer bug".

  The other is a picture of Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist who rose to the ranks of United States Navy rear admiral.

  Her plaque lists several contributions -- inventing the first compiler, inventing the COBOL programming language, and for literally "debugging" the Mark II computer by pulling a moth out of it.

  You continue into Hopper Library and make your way to the classroom in the back that MetaCoders rents for their coding classes.  

  You peer in and instantly recognize that the class is in Story Mode.  But this time, the person telling the story is a student of about 16 years old.  He is wearing a MetaCoders hoodie that reads "Junior Coach" on the back.  You half-expect him to be telling the story of Grace Hopper and the moth -- but as you listen, you realize that he is telling his own story.

  "I started at MetaCoders three years ago," he says.  "I still remember my first class.  I was nervous.  I was a bit awkward.  I was there because I wanted to learn how to code computer games.  How many of you are here today because you want to learn to code games?"

  The majority of the seven students raise their hands.  One kid starts to joke that he's here because he wants to learn how to be a hacker so he can --

  "Good!" says the junior coach, directing the attention back to himself. "You'll definitely learn how to make games.  And you'll definitely learn what 'hacking' means.  But I want you to know that I learned a lot more than just coding in my three years at MetaCoders.  Does anyone know what leadership skills are?"

  Most of the kids raise their hands.  The kid who wants to be a hacker stands up and starts to "helpfully" demonstrate what it means to be a leader by giving a mock speech: "Four score and seven years ago--".  

  This time the actual coach, whose nametag reads "Ruby", steps in.  "Jonah, sit down," she says.  The other students, who had been starting to giggle, go silent.  "If you interrupt Story Mode again, I'll ask MetaCoders to contact your parents."  Then to the class, "Who here besides Jonah can tell me how many points of focus there should be during Story Mode?"  

  Several of the kids raise their hands -- as does Jonah.  But Ruby doesn't call on any of them.  To your surprise, she looks directly at you.  "It looks like we have a guest.  Do @b{you} know how many points of focus there should be during Story Mode?" 

  "Um," you say, "one?"

  "Correct!" says Ruby.  Then to Jonah: "When you direct everyone's attention to yourself, you're creating a second point of focus -- which is both rude and against the rules.  I like that you want to tell stories, and I think you'd make a great junior coach one day -- but can I count on you to not to disrupt another coach's Story Mode from now on?"

   Jonah murmers that he won't.

   Ruby goes on, "If you want to start training to be a junior coach, see me at the end of class.  I can give you a story to learn for next week." 

   Jonah perks up.  Ruby instructs the junior coach to go on.  

   "Does anyone know what leadership skills are?" he asks again.  He gets an answer from a non-Jonah in the room, and continues with his story.  "I'm planning to continue being a junior coach until I'm 17 -- but then I'm going to apply to be a real coach and actually get paid to help run summer camps." Several of the students perk up at the idea of getting a job.  "Then, I'm going to go to college out of state and study computer science -- but I plan to come back home every summer and coach MetaCoders summer camps.  How many of you might want to be a coach one day?"

   Most of the students, including Jonah, raise their hands.

   "Nice!" Ruby cuts in.  "Learning to code and learning to coach go hand in hand.  When you're learning to code, you @b{always} have to coach at least one person.  Who is that?"
  
   Jonah's hand shoots up.  

   "Jonah?" she says.

   "Yourself?" he says.

   "Correct!" she says.  "MetaCoders coaches study coding and also how people's brains learn to code.  That's an important skill even if you're just coaching yourself.  Everyone here has a brain right?"
 
    The kids laugh, and Ruby uses the shift in energy to transition the class to Game Mode.

    The junior coach walks over to you.  "So you're becoming a coach too?" 

    "Yeah," you say.  "It sounds like you know a lot more than me, though."

    "Not really," he says.  "I mean, you're a grown up.  You know what that means, right?"

    "What?"

    "You have more stories than I do.  Coach Ruby is always telling stories about things she did and problems she solved -- not even just about coding.  Last week, she told the class a story about the word 'grit'.  Do you know what grit is?"

    "I think so," you say.  "Like sticking with something."

    "Yeah.  She told a story about how she used to want to be a novelist, but she kept writing the first page of novels and not finishing them.  She always got discouraged and quit.  She didn't have grit.  But then one day, for Nanowrimo, she --"

    "For what?"

    "Oh, yeah, like I said: her stories aren't always about coding.  Nanowrimo is... I think it means 'National Novel Writing Month'.  It's a thing writers do in November.  Anyway, she decided she was going to practice grit by starting a novel on November 1st and finishing it in a moth, and not asking herself whether or not it was good or not until December 1st.  She made a rule for herslef that she was only allowed to write, and she wasn't allowed to even go back and read her own writing.  She said that by the end of the moth she @b{hated} the novel -- but she @b{loved} that she had done it.  She said she would rather have written a bad novel than none at all."

   "Then she connected that back to coding?"

   "Yeah, she always does.  But that's my point -- coaches are people who are good at telling stories and running games.  It helps if you have a bunch of stories already.  They don't all have to be about coding."

   You nod.  "I guess they can just be about learning." 

   "Right.  Cuz, we all have brains.  And none of us have instruction manuals for our brains."

   "How did you get so wise about this stuff?" you ask.  "You're only, like, 16."

   "It's something Ruby likes to say: 'We all have brains -- which are like computeres without instruction manuals.'  She's always talking about metacognition -- thinking about your own brain and how it learns new things.  It's part of the MetaCoders coach training materials.  But then again, you're only on Chapter 1, so you probably haven't learned about it yet."

   You start to realize that MetaCoders has a consistent set of values -- ones that pertain in equal parts to the learning of coding and the science of learning.  You figure that if a 16-year-old kid can learn this stuff, then so can you.
