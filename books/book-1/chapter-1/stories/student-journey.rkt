  As you walk into Hopper Library, you see two pictures hanging on a wall.  One is a photograph of a piece of paper with a moth taped to it.  The plaque beneath it simply reads, "a literal computer bug".

  The other is a picture of Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist who rose to the ranks of United States Navy rear admiral.

  Her plaque lists several contributions -- inventing the first compiler, inventing the COBOL programming language, and for literally "debugging" the Mark II computer by pulling a moth out of it.

  You continue into Hopper Library and make your way to the classroom in the back that MetaCoders rents for their coding classes.  

  You peer in and instantly recognize that the class is in Story Mode.  But this time, the person telling the story is a student of about 16 years old.  He is wearing a MetaCoders hoodie that reads "Junior Coach" on the back.  You half-expect him to be telling the story of Grace Hopper and the moth -- but as you listen, you realize that he is telling his own story.

  "I started at MetaCoders three years ago," he says.  "I still remember my first class.  I was nervous.  I was a bit awkward.  I was there because I wanted to learn how to code computer games.  How many of you are here today because you want to learn to code games?"

  The majority of the seven students raise their hands.  One kid starts to joke that he's here because he wants to learn how to be a hacker so he can --

  "Good!" says the Junior coach, directing the attention back to himself. "You'll definitely learn how to make games.  And you'll definitely learn what 'hacking' means.  But I want you to know that I learned a lot more than just coding in my three years at MetaCoders.  Does anyone know what leadership skills are?"

  Most of the kids raise their hands.  The kid who wants to be a hacker stands up and starts to "helpfully" demonstrate what it means to be a leader by giving a mock speech.  This time the actual coach <<steps in>> 
  
History of student -- in our classes for X years, learned more than coding. Learned leadership, communication skills, grit etc


Set the scene -- introduce a Jr coach teaching alongside an experienced coach (Joseph?)

Going to be an intern this summer

Future -- could go off to college for CS, return and be coach for summers, etc
