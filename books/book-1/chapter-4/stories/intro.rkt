  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this chapter, we'll be visiting a 4th-year software engineering class at Babbage University -- where we'll see that students usually learn git as one of the last things they do in a 4-year degree.

  We'll discuss why, at MetaCoders, we believe it should be the first thing you do.

  Also, if you complete the assessment, you'll also be uploading your own coach bio to Github -- which will allow us (at MetaCoders HQ) to incorporate your bio into our main site at metacoders.org.
