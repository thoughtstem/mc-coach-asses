   Back at the Department of Neuroscience, <<you go to the "observation deck">>

   Dr. Joy Siegmund <<meets you>> 

   "Back for more?"

   "Yes, but this time--" you begin.

   "Here," she says, handing you a Nintendo Switch.  "Play." 

   You are about to protest, but you see Tetris on the screen.  Not one to let a game of Tetris be lost without reason, you begin to play...

   She guides you to a chair.  You murmer a thanks as you continue.  The game gets faster and faster, but just as you are about to win, she returns and says, "I'm ready now.  I can take that off your hands."

   "One moment," you say, "I'm almost --"

   She knocks the Nintendo Switch out of your hands, just as you are about to sink one of the long skinny blocks into the perfect spot.  

   "Hey!" you protest.  

   "Here's some coffee," she says apologetically, handing you the mug.  "I'm sorry I had to do that.  But I needed you to see what it feels like to have a flow state interrupted."

   "You could have warned me at least," you say.

   "Exactly," she says.  "Flow states are enjoyable.  We don't like having them interrupted.  Being forwarned does help, though."
